     Your code must meet the following requirements:
        (i) The comparison of two strings must be done by checking them one
            character at a time, without using any C string library functions.
            That is, write your own while/for loop to do this.
       (ii) The swap of two strings must be done by copying them 
            (using a temp variable of your choice) one character at a time,
            without using any C string library functions.
            That is, write your own while/for loop to do this.
      (iii) You are allowed to use strlen() to calculate string lengths.
