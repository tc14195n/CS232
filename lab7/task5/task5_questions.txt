1.By searching the function name “strcmp” in the assembly text, what instruction calls strcmp?

lea     rax, [rbp-8]
        mov     esi, OFFSET FLAT:password
        mov     rdi, rax
        call    strcmp
        test    eax, eax
        jne     .L2

JYM: wrong compiler you are using?

2.Where is the password “secret” stored?
It's being stored in the non-volatile ESI register
JYM: where does constants get stored when we discussed it during first half of semester?
